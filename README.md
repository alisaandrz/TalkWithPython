## Introduction

This Python script is a simple interactive program that engages with the user by asking questions and providing responses based on their input. It aims to create a friendly conversation by asking about the user's name, the time of day, their current course, and whether they are tired, as well as some questions involving numbers. It then responds to these inputs with positive and friendly messages. Some phrases include joking.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the `cd` command. For example:
